### One Question

Beeing a programmer, I always was faced with systems. Big systems, small systems, interconnected system, operating systems and more. Although computer science is not as old as the mechanic engineering, and despite computer science is deeply rooted in mathematics, the "science" is on the way to become an "engineering". Everyone touched computers professionally learned about models, algorithms, data structures and enginneering tools like UML, high level programming languages, requirements and much more. 

I've got introduced to many programmers, professionals as well as hobbists. After a lot of talks with them and cooperation as well as own practices, I still have no clear insight how to build a system from an engineering perspective. And this is strange, because I'm an electronics engineer. As such I've learned the building blocks of electronics, the basic parts like resistors and transistors, digital logic, electro-magnetics and how to assemble them. Every thing has its role, its place in the world of physics and it the world of engineering, too. But software?

### Path through the Programmers World

My professional carrier started 30 years ago as software developer. I've tried out a lot of programming languages, and most of them felt like the same thing in a different costume. Everything was about to write down data structures and tell what to do with the data, step by step. By doing calculations about electromagnetic fields, writing code looked naturally: just take the formulas, write dem as code with a good numeric library, think a little bit about where to put the data and that's it. Is this really a system?

Some years before, during my studies about philosophy,  I've got introduced to **Smalltalk**. At this time I hadn't this fix view on algorithms and data structures, and the communicating objects, the simple way how to send messages to objects, all put together in an application,  and many more things. This framework of simple elements resulting in something easy to use tool pushed the idea of what a system might me. 

Many years later I bought a book about **LISP** and learned what can do just be this simple model of manipulating lists. Also, the idea of functional programming was new to me. Beeing elegant and small, Lisp compiler in its "physical" representation looked not like a system, although the model behind it does. 

It's not a long time ago when I meet **Prolog**. Suddenly, calculation or algorithms were pushed to back stage, the logical structure of data - or better what is known and what is to be find out - now was prominent on stage. System now seems to be the network of logical statements. In addition, the development of the knowlegde was in focus. 

The basic aspects are 

-  data, their organisation and access
-  computation as application of rules 
-  message sending

### One Question, more Precise

What are the characteristics of a system ? the answer will be tried by changing the questions what forms a system? What are the influences of history (versions before), components (libraries) and thinking model?

### Bsic parts of a system

Basic parts of a system are 
-  !(S, S\*) Structure change - What are structures for data, message sending computation systems
- +(S, F) Effect triggering
+ >(F, S, S\*) Effects changing structure
