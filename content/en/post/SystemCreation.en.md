### One Question

Beeing a programmer, I always was faced with systems. Big systems, small systems, interconnected system, operating systems and more. Although computer science is not as old as the mechanic engineering, and despite computer science is deeply rooted in mathematics, the "science" is on the way to become an "engineering". Everyone touched computers professionally learned about models, algorithms, data structures and enginneering tools like UML, high level programming languages, requirements and much more. 

I've got introduced to many programmers, professionals as well as hobbists. After a lot of talks with them and cooperation as well as own practices, I still have no clear insight how to build a system from an engineering perspective. And this is strange, because I'm an electronics engineer. As such I've learned the building blocks of electronics, the basic parts like resistors and transistors, digital logic, electro-magnetics and how to assemble them. Every thing has its role, its place in the world of physics and it the world of engineering too. But software?
